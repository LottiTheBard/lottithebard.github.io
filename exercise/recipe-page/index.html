            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups evaporated milk</li>
            <li>6 to 8 cardamon pods, lightly crushed</li>
            <li>3 cinnamon sticks</li>
            <li>1 ginger cube (ora small piece of freshy ginger)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup light brown suger (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 black/red tea bags</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium pot, combine the water, evaporated milk, cardamon
                pods, cinnamon sticks and ginger. Bring the mixture to a gentle 
                boil over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once is starts bubbling reduce the heat to low and let it simmer
                for about 5 to 7 minutes. This allows the spices to infuse the
                milk and water with their rich, warm flavors.
            </li>    
            <li>
                Place the tea bags into the pot and let them steep for 3 to 5
                minutes, depending on how strong you like your tea. Stir
                occasionally to help the tea blend with the spiced milk. 
                You'll know it's ready when the color turns a deep caramel 
                brown. Stir in the brown sugar until it dissolves completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the vanilla extract and let it simmer for another minute to 
                enhance the flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the pot from the heat and carefully strain the tea into 
                cups to remove the spices and tea bags.
            </li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
