                    The <b>Australian Shepherd</b> is a breed of herding dog 
                    from the United States. The name of the breed is technically 
                    a misnomer, as it was developed in California in the 19th 
                    century. It is believed to have its origins in sheepdog 
                    breeds from northwest Spain, as well as collies imported, 
                    alongside sheep, from Australia and New Zealand; the breed 
                    reportedly took its name from this trade. Originally used 
                    solely as a herding dog, the Australian Shepherd has become 
                    one of the most popular companion dog breeds in North 
                    America.

                    The Australian Shepherd descends in part from pastoral dogs 
                    brought to herd Spanish flocks in North America as early as 
                    the 1500s. There is some speculation that these dogs 
                    included the Carea Leonés, a mountain sheepdog that can 
                    display the eye color and merle coat found in many 
                    contemporary Australian Shepherds. It is sometimes 
                    claimed that the Basque Shepherd Dog and the Pyrenean 
                    Sheepdog were also among the ancestors of the breed. The 
                    breed as it is known today developed in California in the 
                    19th century, as a sheep herding dog for Californian 
                    shepherds. The Australian Shepherd is also believed to be 
                    descended from a variety of herding dogs imported to 
                    California with imported sheep, including collies from 
                    Australia and New Zealand. It was from these ancestors that 
                    the breed took its name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Australian Shepherd spread from California throughout 
                    the Western United States where it became extremely popular 
                    with ranchers who valued the breed's sheep working 
                    qualities, as well as their ability to handle cattle and 
                    other livestock. A purely working breed for over a 
                    century, the Australian Shepherd was virtually unknown 
                    outside of the livestock industry until the mid-20th 
                    century when the breed was popularised by Jay Sisler, 
                    a rodeo performer, at rodeos across the western states with 
                    his Australian Shepherds performing all manner of tricks. A 
                    breed club was soon formed to promote the breed, the 
                    Australian Shepherd Club of America, and kennel club 
                    recognition followed in 1979 when the breed was recognised 
                    by the United Kennel Club. The breed was subsequently 
                    recognised by the American Kennel Club in the 1990s and 
                    later the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

                    From the late-20th century the Australian Shepherd has 
                    increasingly been seen in conformation shows and it has 
                    become an extremely popular companion dog. In 2019 it was 
                    ranked by the American Kennel Club as the 15th most popular 
                    breed of dog in the United States.

                    The Australian Shepherd is a medium-sized, athletic breed; 
                    they typically stand between 18 and 23 inches (46 and 58 cm)
                    and weigh between 35 and 70 pounds (16 and 32 kg). The 
                    parent club, the Australian Shepherd Club of America's 
                    breed standard states male dogs should stand between 20 and 
                    23 inches (51 and 58 cm) and females between 18 and 21 
                    inches (46 and 53 cm), at the withers; the standard does 
                    allow individual animals to exceed these limits slightly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Australian Shepherd has a moderately long and wavy 
                    double coat that has a dense undercoat and coarse topcoat; 
                    the coat is short on the face and well feathered on the rear
                    of the legs. The breed is known for its unique colorations 
                    and variable coat patterns, it being said no two dogs 
                    sharing a coat. The breed standard allows for blue merle, 
                    red merle, solid black or solid red, with or without white 
                    markings and with or without tan points.

                <p>
                    The Australian Shepherd is described as intelligent, active,
                    loyal, protective, playful, and adaptive. The modern breed 
                    is predominantly bred for pets; despite this, many retain a 
                    strong herding instinct and it is not uncommon for companion 
                    dogs of the breed to try to herd children or other pets. A 
                    very active breed, the Australian Shepherd is known to 
                    become destructive if it does not receive adequate exercise.

                    A 2024 UK study found a median life expectancy of 13.7 years 
                    based on a sample of 62 deaths, which was above the median 
                    of 12.7 years for purebreeds and 12 years for crossbreeds.

                <p>
                    Based on a sample of 48 still-living dogs, the most common 
                    health concerns noted by owners were eye problems (red eye, 
                    epiphora, conjunctivitis, and cataracts). Dermatological and 
                    respiratory problems also ranked high.

                    The Australian Shepherd is one of the more commonly affected 
                    breeds for an autosomal recessive mutation of the MDR1 gene. 
                    This mutation causes greater sensitivity to certain drugs at 
                    normally safe doses, including ivermectin. A test is 
                    available to determine if a particular dog carries the 
                    mutated gene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Australian Shepherds show relatively low levels 
                    (approximately 6%) of hip dysplasia, a heritable condition 
                    where the femur does not fit securely in the pelvic socket 
                    of the hip joint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Australian Shepherd is one of the breeds more commonly 
                    affected by hereditary cataracts.
                </p>
                <h3 id="double-merle">Double Merle</h3>
                <p>
                    Double merles often have excessive light or white areas and 
                    can have hearing and vision problems as a result of having 
                    two copies of the merle gene. Homozygous merles can be deaf 
                    or blind, or express iris colobomas, retinal detachment, 
                    cataracts, persistent pupillary membrane, a displacement of 
                    the lens, equatorial staphyloma, night blindness and 
                    microphthalmia. Audio impairment or deafness usually 
                    develops after the birth of a puppy with their ear canal 
                    still closed. The white color of double merles is produced 
                    due to the lack of melanocytes which provide high potassium 
                    levels in the endolymph surrounding the cochlea's hair 
                    cells. There is no surgery or treatment that can reduce the 
                    damage. Loss of hearing is directly linked to the amount of 
                    pigmentation cells a dog has. The same pigment that is 
                    lacking in the ear can also be lacking in the eyes, 
                    affecting its development. Although many believe that only 
                    dogs with blue eyes have eye problems, it is not correct. 
                    Due to the contrast between eye problems and blue eyes, eye 
                    conditions in blue-eyed dogs are much easier to spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term "lethal white" originated from horses born with 
                    lethal white syndrome, and has since evolved to often 
                    describe dogs born with the double merle trait. This trait 
                    is found in many breeds, but most commonly found in 
                    Australian Shepherds. The name "lethal white" is a misnomer, 
                    as this genetic condition is not lethal to the dogs; it is 
                    often the breeder who is lethal to the pups by culling them 
                    immediately after birth. Many consider the term 
                    "lethal white" to be derogatory.

                    Like other herding breeds, these dogs excel at many dog 
                    sports, especially herding also known as stockdog, dog 
                    agility, dock diving/dock jumping, obedience, rally, 
                    tracking, disc, and flyball. Herding instincts and 
                    trainability can be measured at noncompetitive instinct 
                    tests. Australian Shepherds that exhibit basic herding 
                    instincts can be trained to compete in ASCA stock dog trials 
                    or AKC herding events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dog has a stride in which its front and back legs cross 
                    over, making for an appearance of "on the edge" speed. The 
                    dogs instinctively use a "pounce" position to deal with 
                    cattle trying to kick them. They also have strong hips and 
                    legs, allowing for fast acceleration and high jumping, 
                    sometimes as high as 4 ft (1.3 m).

                <p>
                    An Australian shepherd named Pockets is credited as being 
                    the oldest dog to earn a title in AKC history, having earned 
                    the Rally Novice title at the age of 15 years, 5 weeks.
