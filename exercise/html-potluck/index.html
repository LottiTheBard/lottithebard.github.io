            The second instalment of boy wizard Harry Potter's adventures at 
            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, based on the novel by 
            JK Rowling. A mysterious elf tells Harry to expect trouble during 
            his second year at Hogwarts, but nothing can prepare him for trees 
            that fight back, flying cars, spiders that talk and deadly warnings 
            written in blood on the walls of the school.

            Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts starts off 
            badly when he learns deranged killer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has 
            escaped from Azkaban prison and is bent on murdering the teenage 
            wizard. While Hermione's (Emma Watson) cat torments Ron's 
            (Rupert Grint) sickly rat, causing a rift among the trio, a swarm 
            of nasty Dementors is sent to protect the school from Black. 
            A mysterious new teacher helps Harry learn to defend himself, but 
            what is his secret tie to Sirius Black?
