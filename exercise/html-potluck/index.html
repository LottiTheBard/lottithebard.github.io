            The second instalment of boy wizard Harry Potter's adventures at 
            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, based on the novel by 
            JK Rowling. A mysterious elf tells Harry to expect trouble during 
            his second year at Hogwarts, but nothing can prepare him for trees 
            that fight back, flying cars, spiders that talk and deadly warnings 
            written in blood on the walls of the school.

            Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts starts off 
            badly when he learns deranged killer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has 
            escaped from Azkaban prison and is bent on murdering the teenage 
            wizard. While Hermione's (Emma Watson) cat torments Ron's 
            (Rupert Grint) sickly rat, causing a rift among the trio, a swarm 
            of nasty Dementors is sent to protect the school from Black. 
            A mysterious new teacher helps Harry learn to defend himself, but 
            what is his secret tie to Sirius Black?

            Harry is mysteriously selected to compete in the prestigious 
            Triwizard Tournament, a thrilling competition that pits him against
            more experienced students from Hogwarts and two rival wizarding 
            schools. Meanwhile, supporters of the evil Lord Voldemort send a 
            shockwave of fear throughout the wizard community when their Dark 
            Mark scorches the sky at the Quidditch World Cup, signalling a 
            return to power.

            Now in his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry learns that many in the 
            wizarding community do not know the truth of his encounter with 
            Lord Voldemort. Cornelius Fudge, minister of Magic, appoints his 
            toady, Dolores Umbridge, as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, 
            for he fears that professor Dumbledore will take his job. But her 
            teaching is deficient and her methods, cruel, so Harry prepares a 
            group of students to defend the school against a rising tide of 
            evil.

                As Death Eaters wreak havoc in both Muggle and Wizard worlds, 
                Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for students. Though Harry 
                suspects there are new dangers lurking within the castle walls, 
                Dumbledore is more intent than ever on preparing the young 
                wizard for the final battle with Voldemort. Teenage 
                hormones run rampant through Hogwarts, presenting a different 
                sort of danger. Love may be in the air, but tragedy looms and 
                Hogwarts may never be the same again.
